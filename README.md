## Additional Informations

### Why include Volta

[Volta][volta]‚Äôs toolchain always keeps track of where you are, it makes sure the tools you use always respect the settings of the project you‚Äôre working on. This means you don‚Äôt have to worry about changing the state of your installed software when switching between projects. For example, it's [used by engineers at LinkedIn][volta-tomdale] to standarize tools and have reproducible development environments.

I recommend to [install][volta-getting-started] Volta and use it to manage your project's toolchain.

### Writing tests in JavaScript

Writing unit tests in TypeScript can sometimes be troublesome and confusing. Especially when mocking dependencies and using spies.

This is **optional**, but if you want to learn how to write JavaScript tests for TypeScript modules, read the [corresponding wiki page][wiki-js-tests].
